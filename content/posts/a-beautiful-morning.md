Today was a beautiful morning\
The sun was shining\
through a cloak of clouds.\
The flowers, bright and fragrant,\
were vibrant in the glow of sunlight.

The breeze was cool and calm,\
Just enough to ruffle your hair.

But in the midst of the heavenly morning,\
I was sad, and desolated.

Because all the beauty of the world couldn't match yours,\
And all the grief of the world couldn't match mine.
