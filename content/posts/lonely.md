I see you down the street, alone  
Walking slowly towards me  
In the cold hazy wind  
That twirls your hair lightly  

Your eyes stare the drab pavement  
Your light steps make no sound  
You slightly move your hand to remove  
The falling hair from your pale face  
And my heart skips a beat  

For a moment you lift your eyes  
And we gaze at each other  
I smile, but you have already looked away  
A few seconds pass, while I  
Dream of you  

Then I look at you again and I see,  
The sad pain of loneliness, your eyes  
Have lost the shine they once had  
Your bag full of books is  
Dragging you down  

Maybe we can meet someday,  
And extinguish our loneliness together  
For I recognize the suffering, the ache  
Of being lonely
